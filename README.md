Webgriffe_Golive
================

Introduction
------------

Golive extension can be helpful either before a site launch or in continuous
integration environment to ensure that changes to Magento settings don't
compromise the site.

*Note:* I'm currently writing a new version of Golive in order to be uesd as a [n98-magerun](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun) plugin. The repository is still private but it will become public as soon as I am finished.

Installation
------------

You can install this extension in several ways:

**Download**

Download the full package, copy the content of the ```src``` directory
in your magento base directory; pay attention not to overwrite
the ```app``` and  ```shell``` folder, only merge their contents into existing
directories;

**Modman**

Install modman Module Manager: https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman

After having installed modman on your system, you can clone this module on your
Magento base directory by typing the following command:

```
$ modman init
$ modman clone git@github.com:aleron75/Webgriffe_Golive.git
```

**Composer**

Install composer: http://getcomposer.org/download/

Install Magento Composer: https://github.com/magento-hackathon/magento-composer-installer

Add the dependency to your ```composer.json```:

```
{
  ...
  "require": {
    ...
    "aleron75/webgriffe_tph-pro": "dev-master",
    ...
  },
  "repositories": [
    ...
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url":  "git@github.com:aleron75/Webgriffe_Golive.git"
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
  "extra": {
    "magento-root-dir": "<magento_installation_dir>/"
  }
  ...
}
```

Then run the following command from the directory where your ```composer.json```
file is contained:

```
php composer.phar install
```

or

```
$ composer install
```

**Common tasks**

After installation:

* if you have cache enabled, disable or refresh it;
* if you have compilation enabled, disable it or recompile the code base.

Usage
------------

The extension is a collection of so called 'Checkers', small classes whose
single responsibility is that of checking whether your Magento installation
has some default settings which should be updated before going live.

For example it checks whether you have changed the HTML Head Default Title or
Description or if you have updated the theme favicon.

Checkers can be run through an easy-to-use shell script:

```
$ php shell/golive.php --domain www.yourdomain.com
```

The output is something like:

```
Webgriffe Go Live 0.3.1
Active Checkers found: 73
Checking current Magento installation... done!

Through the following command you can get checkers' description:

```
$ php shell/golive.php --explain 34,35,36
```

The output is something like:

```
Webgriffe Go Live 0.3.1

```

The description you see is taken from the config.xml file; almost
all of them still must be written in a better way.

Checkers are declared and activated through the config.xml file.

New checks can be added by simply copying a checker configuration node in the
config.xml file and changing what is need to be changed.

Others require a Checker Class to be written; it usually takes only a few lines
of code. Take a look at existing ones to learn how to write your own.

Each Checker returns one of the following exit code:

* __error__: the check failed and severity was set to error
* __warning__: the check failed and severity was set to warning
* __none__: the check passed
* __skip__: the check couldn't be applied (for example: Google Analytics Account Number check is skipped if GA is not activated)

The shell script exit code corresponds to the number of errors found.

Checker's exit code severity can be configured. They come with default severity
exit codes based on personal experience but feel free to change them based on
your needs.

Golive is developed "the Magento way" so it's fully extensible.

This project is at its early stages and is still under development; shell script
is raw and still has to be beautified and more Checkers have to be developed.

In other words: any feedback or help is extremely appreciated.
